### Documentation Standards

#### Function Documentation
```python
def add_transaction(dimension, action, amount_kg, current_stock_kg, 
                   cost_per_kg=0, sell_per_kg=0, notes='', custom_date=None):
    """
    Add a transaction to the database.
    
    Args:
        dimension (str): Bag dimension identifier
        action (str): Type of transaction ('Stock Added', 'Sale', 'Adjustment')
        amount_kg (float): Amount in kilograms (signed value)
        current_stock_kg (float): Stock level after transaction
        cost_per_kg (float, optional): Cost per kg for purchases. Defaults to 0.
        sell_per_kg (float, optional): Selling price per kg. Defaults to 0.
        notes (str, optional): Additional notes. Defaults to ''.

        >>> add_transaction('10x16', 'Stock Added', 50, 150, cost_per_kg=120)
    """
```

### Testing Guidelines

#### Writing Tests
```python
import pytest
from complete_inventory_system import normalize_dimension, get_current_stock

def test_normalize_dimension():
    """Test dimension normalization."""
    assert normalize_dimension("10 x 16") == "10x16"
    assert normalize_dimension("10*16") == "10x16"
    assert normalize_dimension("10X16") == "10x16"

def test_get_current_stock_empty():
    """Test getting stock for non-existent dimension."""
    # Setup test database
    stock = get_current_stock("nonexistent")
    assert stock == 0
```

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=complete_inventory_system

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_inventory.py::test_normalize_dimension
```
